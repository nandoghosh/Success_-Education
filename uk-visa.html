                    <h3 class="fw-bold text-color-p">How to Apply for a UK Visa?</h3>
                    <p class="text-color-p mt-3">The UK visa application process depends a lot on the type of visa that you are applying for. Especially if your type of visa belongs to one of the Points-Based System category. Though most of the requirements are the same for each category, the way they are evaluated in the system differs. There are also additional requirements that vary from one to another category.</p>

                    <p class="text-color-p mt-3">The earliest you can apply for a UK visa is three months before the date of your intended trip to here.   Yet, keep in mind that the processing of your visa application may take up to three weeks. Apply in advance, so you can give enough time to the consulate for the processing of your visa.</p>

                    <p class="text-color-p mt-4">The PBS system evaluates visa candidates based on the points they can gather by meeting visa requirements. Each visa requirement has its points, and there is an appointed number of points the candidate should gather in order to receive the visa.</p>

                    </ul>

                    <h4 class=" text-color-p mt-5">Visas sometimes can forbid the holder doing several activities such as:</h4>

                        <li class="mt-3">Using public funds;</li>

                    <p class="text-color-p mt-3">It may take around three weeks for a UK visa to be processed. The current UK Visa processing time differs from one application to the other based on several factors. These are:</p>

                        <li class="mt-3">the visa type you are applying for,</li>

                    <p class="text-color-p mt-4">The ‘priority service’ enables you to get a decision on your application within five working days for an additional fee of £500. Whereas, the ‘super priority service’ that will cost you £800 aside from the visa fee, and enables you to get a decision by the end of the next working day.</p>

                    <p class="text-color-p mt-3">Some of the most common reasons why UK visas are refused are as follows:</p>
                    <ul class="mt-3">
                        <li class="mt-3">Missing documents. This is the most common reason why applications are rejected. One missing document and the embassy will be done with your application. You won’t even get a second chance to submit what is missing. You will need to start a brand new application.</li>    
                        <li class="mt-3">Incorrect and mismatching information in your documents.</li>    
                        <li class="mt-3">Insufficient financial means to support your stay in the UK.</li>    
                        <li class="mt-3">Not meeting the English language requirement.</li>    
                        <li class="mt-3">Incorrect organization of documents.</li>    
                    </ul>

                <div class="mt-5">
                    <h3 class="fw-bold text-color-p">What Can I Do In Case of Visa Denial?</h3>
                    <p class="text-color-p mt-3">If your application for a UK visa is rejected, you can just give up, or:</p>
                    <ul class="mt-3">
                        <li class="mt-3">Reapply for the visa. If you reapply, make sure that you do not make the previous mistake, or you improve your situation in order to meet the requirements.</li>    
                        <li class="mt-3">Appeal on Human Rights ground. You should have a strong basis to appeal a visa rejection decision.</li>    
                        <li class="mt-3">Challenge the decision via judicial review. You can do this if you have a strong reason to believe that your application has been rejected illegally or irrationally or there has been procedural unfairness during the processing of your application file.</li>      
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class=" text-color-p mt-5">Will I get a refund?</h4>
                    <p class="text-color-p mt-3">No, it is not possible to have the fee you paid refunded. The fee for a UK visa is required in order to cover the expenses that come out of the processing of your application, thus refunding is not possible if your visa is denied or you decide to withdraw your application while it is being processed.</p>
                    <p class="text-color-p mt-4">Moreover, when you reapply for a UK visa after your fist application has been rejected, you will need to pay the fee again.</p>

                    <h3 class="fw-bold text-color-p">Can I Get a UK Visa If I Have a Criminal Record?</h3>
                    <p class="text-color-p mt-3">If you have been involved in criminal activity in the past, the UK authorities will still receive and process your UK visa application. Yet, the Home Office will treat your application differently from the way it treats applications of people with no criminal past.</p>
                    <p class="text-color-p mt-4">The length of your sentence and the time that has passed since then are very important in such cases. Your application will be automatically rejected if you have been imprisoned for:</p>
                    <ul class="mt-3">
                        <li class="mt-3">4 years or more.</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-color-p mt-4">Your application will also be rejected on the spot if within the period of 12 months before the application is decided, you have been convicted of or admitted an offense for which you received a non-custodial sentence or out of court disposal that is recorded on your criminal record.</p>

                    <p class="text-color-p mt-3">If the visa sticker on your passport contains the words ‘Police registration’ or ‘Register with police in 7 days of entry’ then you will need to register with the police once you are in the UK with a valid visa.</p>
                    <p class="text-color-p mt-4">You have seven days to go to the police for registration after you arrive in the UK. Note that if you do not register with the police, your visa validity will be shortened and you may need to leave the UK.</p>

                    <p class="text-color-p mt-4">To visit other European countries, you may have to apply for a Schengen visa from the UK which allows you to travel for tourism or business purposes for a maximum of 90 days.</p>
                    <p class="text-color-p mt-4">You can apply for a visa from the UK even if you are not a British citizen. Although the procedures to apply it are almost the same for all applicants you must familiarize yourself with the specifics if you are applying from the UK.</p>
                    <p class="text-color-p mt-4">If you need to obtain a Schengen visa from the UK, it is required that you purchase a Schengen visa health insurance plan that covers your entire period of stay in Europe.</p>

                    <h4 class=" text-color-p mt-5">Traveling to USA</h4>
                    <p class="text-color-p mt-4">To travel to the USA, you might be required to apply for a US visa in the UK, depending on your nationality. If you are a citizen of a country in the Visa Waiver Program, you are not required to apply for a visa, but you will have to apply for ESTA instead.</p>
